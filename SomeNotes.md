Feature Engineering

TLDR; 
Feature engineering is like preparing ingredients for cooking. Just like how we need to clean, cut and chop vegetables before cooking, in machine learning, we need to clean and transform data to make it ready for use by the computer. This is important because the computer needs data to be in a certain format to be able to understand it and make predictions. By doing this, we can help the computer learn and make more accurate predictions.


Feature engineering is a crucial step in machine learning where you extract the relevant information from raw data and transform it into a format that can be used by machine learning algorithms. It involves selecting, extracting, and transforming the input features (i.e., the attributes or variables) in a dataset to make them suitable for use in a predictive model.

The goal of feature engineering is to create features that are informative, non-redundant, and relevant to the problem at hand. This process can involve a variety of techniques, such as scaling, normalization, binning, encoding, feature selection, and feature creation.

Scaling and normalization involve rescaling the values of input features to make them comparable and easier for the machine learning algorithm to process. Binning involves grouping continuous values into discrete categories, which can help simplify the input space and make it more interpretable. Encoding involves converting categorical variables into numerical values, which can be processed by machine learning algorithms.

Feature selection involves selecting a subset of relevant features from the input space, which can help improve the accuracy and interpretability of the model. Feature creation involves deriving new features from existing ones, such as computing ratios, differences, or combinations of features, which can provide additional information and improve the predictive performance of the model.

Overall, feature engineering is a critical step in the machine learning pipeline, as it can significantly impact the performance of a predictive model. The process requires both domain knowledge and creativity to extract meaningful insights from the data and transform them into informative features that can be used to make accurate predictions.
